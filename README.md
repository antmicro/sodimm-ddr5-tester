## Overview

This project contains open hardware KiCad design files for an experimental platform built around the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, which can be used to interface with SO-DIMM DDR5 RAM modules.
It is also possible to use the platform with single LPDDR5 memories by using custom adapters named [LPDDR5 testbeds](https://github.com/antmicro/lpddr5-testbed).

The SO-DIMM DDR5 Tester can be used with the open source [Rowhammer Tester](https://github.com/antmicro/rowhammer-tester) suite.
